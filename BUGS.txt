BUGS FOR STRETCHPLAYER
----------------------

Here is an unordered list of complaints, shorcomings, wishes, and
bugs.

* On some systems, and when using Jack2 (Debian's 1.9.5~dfsg-13)
  stretchplayer is /immediately/ disconnected from Jack as soon as you
  click the file-open dialog.

* The GUI is way too active.  On my machine, it get's 280 paint events
  every second and typically uses 20-30% CPU.

* Possible clicks on A/B Repeat (no crossfading).

* QFont::setStretch() doesn't work on all fonts.
  Where it doesn't work, they get massively
  kerned.  Would be better to just make the font
  smaller.  This is especially bad on Windows.

* The font layout is .... ok.... but still looks
  a little amateurish.

* Doesn't work with buffer size < 256

* Doesn't work on older computers (<= 800 MHz)

* Memory hog.  Needs to stream.

* Add MP3 support.

* Create CLI version.

* Create Windows version with MSI package.

* Add PortAudio support

* Sliders don't match the UI.

* debian package

* stretchplayer.desktop file

* Get the version into the CMake stuff.

* needs a help/version button.

* one user complained that unity gain on the fader is at 85% rather
  than 100%.

* Faders need a detented spot (stretch fader near 100%, volume fader
  near unity gain).

* Using arrow keys will not get the stretch fader to go to the extreme
  position.
